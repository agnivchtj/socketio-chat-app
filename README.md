# Socket.io Chat App

This is a ReactJS chat application built using the Socket.io library to enable real-time, event-driven communication between client and server-side. In the project, this was used to enable functionality such as adding users to their selected chat rooms, displaying text messages on the chat and removing users upon their exit. With websockets, this is more efficient in terms of network traffic and allows the server to push real-time data to multiple subscribed clients. The project involved working with Node.js, React, React Hooks and Material UI.
